## Since I have decided to join:

1.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
2.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
3.  **Tweet my progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
4.  Follow [Alex, creator of #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/ka11away) & [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep myself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
9.  Important: (see No.2 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that I will stick to my own commitment, given that I will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
10.  If I find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
