## Day 017

Day 017, I started building the snake game using the `Turtle graphics` module and have successfully created the snake and been able to control its movement with the arrow keys.

## Run the code
The `main.py` file is in the snake_game folder.
To run the app use the command below.

```python3
python3 ./snake_game/main.py
```
