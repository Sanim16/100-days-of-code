## This is a reboot

I had started the @udemy [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?kw=100&src=sac&couponCode=BFCPSALE24) course and gotten up to day 16 of the course before I stopped.

As a result of this the first few days will consist of reviews and possible refactoring of the code written.

The day 1 consists of reviews and refactoring day 4 and day 5 of the @udemy [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?kw=100&src=sac&couponCode=BFCPSALE24).
